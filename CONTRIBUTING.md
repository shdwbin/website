# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to help out Shadowbin! Before getting into it, please be sure to read our guidelines and requirements.

## Guidelines

1. Follow the repository's [**Code of Conduct.**](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
2. Play nice and be fair. OSS is about cooperation and collaboration, not putting fire under peoples' feet.
4. Don't be afraid to make mistakes and learn! We're here to grow.

## Requirements

Contributing to Shadow begins with making an [**Issue for the repository.**](https://github.com/shdwbin/website/issues)
Issues are used to keep track of our milestones for each major version's release, as well as our project board.
We will also pay attention to Issues the most.

When creating an Issue, please keep the following in mind:

- If focused on a feature request, we appreciate design suggestions and how to code them, but isn't required.
- If you fail to follow our **Code of Conduct** agreement, your Issue will be closed without warning. We test people on good faith, after all!
- Issues for new features *must* have their appropriate [**Pull Request**](https://github.com/shdwbin/website/pulls) linked to them. You can easily do this via. mentioning it in the Issue *afterwards* or as a comment.
- Code suggestions for potential fixes on bug reports are unnecessary. When one is found, numerous aspects may change depending on severity.

After an Issue is created, please wait a minimum of 24 hours before a core developer may give an official response back.
Other Contributors may speak, but they do not officially represent Shadowbin. Contributors are welcome to giving their own feedback!
